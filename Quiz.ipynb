    "Explanation: Spearman's rank correlation is a non-parametric measure of correlation, which is appropriate to use when the data is ordinal or non-parametric. It measures the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two continuous or ordinal variables.\n",

    "Explanation: Spearman's rank correlation is more robust to outliers because it is a non-parametric measure of correlation that uses ranks instead of actual data values. It measures the strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between two continuous or ordinal variables, which is less affected by extreme values than a linear relationship.\n",

    "Explanation: The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, with negative values indicating a negative correlation and positive values indicating a positive correlation. A value of -0.85 indicates a strong negative correlation between the two variables.\n",

    "     None of the above\n",

    "Explanation: Unlike the Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is based on the ranks of the data rather than the actual values, making it more suitable for detecting non-linear relationships.\n",

    "A scientist is studying the relationship between the number of hours spent studying and the final exam scores of 50 students. He computes a Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.2. What does this result indicate?\n",

    "    There is a strong negative correlation between the two variables\n",

    "    There is no significant correlation between the two variables\n",
    "\n",
    "    There is a weak positive correlation between the two variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and 1 indicates a perfect positive correlation. A coefficient of -0.2 indicates a weak negative correlation between the number of hours spent studying and the final exam scores. This means that as the number of hours spent studying increases, the final exam scores tend to decrease, but the relationship is not very strong. Therefore, option b) is the correct answer.\n",
